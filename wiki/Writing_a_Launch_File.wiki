#summary How to write a launch file for your motor.

= Writing a Launch File =
While it is possible to run the EposManager from the command line through rosrun, the easiest way by far is from a launch file. Here, you will learn how to write a launch file to control any number of EPOS' in a chain.

Assuming you have already followed the previous tutorials and created your parameter files, create a new directory called "launch". In the directory, create a new launch file named "MyMotorTest.launch". Finally, copy the sample launch file below into "MyMotorTest.launch".

== Sample Launch File ==
{{{
<launch>
	<rosparam command="load" file="$(find epos_tutorials)/params/MyEpos.yaml" ns="motors" />

	<node name="NewEpos" pkg="EposManager" type="EposManager"  ns="motors" output="screen" args="MyEpos" >
		<param name="Port" value="USB0" />
		<param name="Protocol" value="USB" />
		<param name="Publish_Rate" value="10" />
	</node>
</launch>
}}}

==The Launch File Explained ==
While this launch file may look complicated, it is actually very simple and straightforward. Below is a breakdown of the code.

=== Loading the Parameters ===
{{{	
<rosparam command="load" file="$(find epos_tutorials)/params/MyEpos.yaml" ns="motors/MyEpos" /> 
}}}

This line loads the parameters from the given parameter file into a specific namespace. The 

{{{
file="$(find epos_tutorials)/params/MyEpos.yaml"
}}}

portion of the line uses the ROS file-system to find the absolute path of the given package, in this case "epos_tutorials". From there, you specify the relative path to the parameter file you are loading into the namespace. 

The namespace is specified by: 
{{{
"ns="motors/MyEpos
}}}
The "motors" before the "MyEpos" is solely for organizational purposes, it can be removed or expanded. The "MyEpos" (or whatever name you wish to belong to each specific EPOS) is mandatory and must be unique. You cannot have two EPOS's in the same namespace or their parameters will overwrite each other.

=== Running the EposManager Node ===
{{{
<node name="NewEpos" pkg="EposManager" type="EposManager" ns="motors" output="screen" args="MyEpos"  >
	<param name="Port" value="USB0" />
	<param name="Protocol" value="USB" />
	<param name="Publish_Rate" value="10" />
</node>
}}}

This next portion runs an instance of the EposManager. Like every ROS node, the name must be unique. In this case, we are only running one EposManager, so that is not an issue. We also give the EposManager a namespace through "ns". Just like the parameter loading above, this namespace can be lengthened or removed completely. The only requirement is that it be the exact same as the namespace used in the parameter loading portion of the file, minus the name of the specific EPOS (in this case MyEpos). The name of the specific EPOS needs to be given in the "args=" argument. This is done so EposManager knows where to search for the parameters for the EPOS it is using. While we are only using one EPOS in this example, you can pass in as many EPOS's as you wish, so long as each one has an associated parameter file. We will discuss using multiple EPOS's in a later tutorial.
