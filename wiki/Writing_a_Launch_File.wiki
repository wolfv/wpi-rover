#summary How to write a launch file for your motor.

= Writing a Launch File =
While it is possible to run the EposManager from the command line through rosrun, the easiest way by far is from a launch file. Here, you will learn how to write a launch file to control any number of EPOS' in a chain.

Assuming you have already followed the previous tutorials and created your parameter files, create a new directory called "launch". In the directory, create a new launch file named "MyMotorTest.launch". Finally, copy the sample launch file below into "MyMotorTest.launch".

== Sample Launch File ==
{{{
<launch>
	<rosparam command="load" file="$(find epos_tutorials)/params/MyEpos.yaml" ns="motors" />

	<node name="NewEpos" pkg="EposManager" type="EposManager" args="MyEpos" ns="motors" output="screen" >
		<param name="Port" value="USB0" />
		<param name="Protocol" value="USB" />
		<param name="Publish_Rate" value="10" />
		<param name="Heartbeat" value="false" />
		<param name="Max_Heartbeat_Attempts" value="20" />
		<param name="Heartbeat_Rate" value="2" />
	</node>
</launch>
